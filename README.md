# Spotify Family Payment Tracker

A simple website as my study for React Typescript applications and handling structured data better using Supabase RESTful API for its database and backend.

The following improvements I'm thinking of adding in the near future are:
- better visualization for more data
- other Spotify Plan types
- member profiles
- leaderboards for members
- and idk what to put in the home page...
